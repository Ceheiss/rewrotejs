### RewroteJS

This is a library made up of (mainly) rewritten array methods such as **forEach**,**indexOf**, and others. The idea is to replicate the specs of each method as closely as possible, in that regard, its value is purely educational (for me that is), and if you really use this in a project you are a mad person.
